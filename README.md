## Introduction

For PP3 Python Essentials, the developer built a battleship game. Although similar to the original player versus computer battleship game, this one is played only by the player. The computer randomly places 10 ships on a 10 x 10 grid and the player has to target them with missiles. The objective is to destroy the computers fleet.

### How To Play

- When the game begins, the player is requested to enter their name and choose a difficulty.
- Depending on the chosen difficulty, the player will have 80, 70, 60 or 50 missiles to launch.
- The computer randomly places 10 ships on the play board, occupying 20 spaces.
- Ships will be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
- The player enters coordinates and launches a missile.
- The game logs how many missiles have been used and how many remain.
- If the player destroys all enemy ships before using all missiles, the player wins.
- If the player uses all missiles and all enemy ships have not been destroyed, the player loses.
- The rules of the game can be accessed at any time by entering '?'.
